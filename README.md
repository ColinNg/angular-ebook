# This Book In a Nutshell
Overall the book is meant as step-by-step Guided Introduction to the Angular Ecosystem - The goal is to include both the "How" but most of all including what is often missing - the "Why".

This ebook is just getting started, I would love to hear your feedback on what you would like it to include. Its freely available for download, please send me your feedback at admin@angular-university.io

Versions used: The code repository of this ebook uses the Angular 4 release, Typescript 2.2 and optionally the Yarn Package manager.

# Why a Step-By-Step Guide for Angular ?
For anyone coming from a Javascript background even in other similar frameworks, from server-side environments like C# or Java, and even from a more traditionally frontend oriented environment like Ruby or Python, the Angular ecosystem at first sight might look completely different.

The goal of this ebook is for you to learn the Angular framework from the point of view of an Application Developer coming from another ecosystem. Why should we use the Angular framework and in which way does it help you build better and more feature-rich applications ? Why Angular ? We are going to take an innovative approach for learning the Angular platform: we are going to present the features of the framework of course, but our main points of focus will be:

- Why is a feature built it a certain way ?
- What problems is it trying to solve ?
- When should we use each feature and why ?
- How much do I need to know about the internals of Angular in order to be proficient using it ?
- Is a given feature commonly used in day to day application development, or is it meant mostly for third party library development ?
- We will give some practical and easy to understand explanations about to the multiple concepts around Angular, Typescript and Single Page Applications in general. The goal is to give you a high-density of those Haha moments, that are really what learning is all about. So in a Nutshell, let’s summarize the content of this guide:

# Table Of Contents

- We are going to start by giving you a convincing explanation on how single page applications work, and why would you want to build an application that way

- Then we are going to guide you through the Angular framework core module, covering everything you need to know to use it effectively: Components, Directives, Pipes, Services – this is the bread and butter of Angular on which everything else is based upon
- We are then going to build a simple service layer together, and cover some of the design principles that we need to use to be able to design Angular services effectively
- We will then cover the Angular Router, and learn how to use it in practice to build the navigation system of our applications
- One of the biggest use cases of Angular is for building form intensive applications. We are going to see how we can use Angular to build forms using the Forms module
- We will end by showing how to test the Components, Directives and Forms that we have been building so far
- We will be using the Angular CLI for our examples

I hope this gives you a better idea of the goal of this book will be : more than covering a feature or concept, the goal of the book is to help understand not only the concept / feature, but also what are the common use cases, when should we use it and why, and what are the advantages.
